# Lab-5-Using-Web-API-s

1) One of the main issues I ran into using the API is that I wanted to have the program ask the user for input that would ask what their favorite genre is.
   And with that information would then create a playlist based on that choice of genre. However, genre is not tied to any of the music in the database so now I can't do shit
   smfh.
   So instead I'm making a program that will let you input popular artists and create 10 song playlist based on those artists. Since they hate me so much.
